// use this command in vscode to setup a virtual env for python

conda create -p venv python==3.10 -y

// Since you create a requirements.txt with boto3 and import json

pip3 install -r requirements.txt

// Also remember to use an IAM use from vscode so you can connect to AWS account and services as a user which has the permissions for bedrock

aws configure
enter the access key etc
